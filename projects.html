                As a way learn CSS and HTML, I decided to created my own website dedicated to showcasing my past experiences and projects. 
                Although I am not certain what else I will put here, I will continue to update this website as I accomplish more.

                In a group of 5, we were tasked to design a device that would increase accessibility to clean water and find the monetary 
                and non-monetary costs associated with it. The hydrocyclone we designed filters out large particles when contaminated water is pumped through it. 
                Particles with higher density will remain in the bottom of the device and cleaner water will escape from the top. Water that comes out need to be put through a water filter 
                before consumption but the device can increase the lifespan of water filters.

                In a group of 6, we made a replica of the Mars Perseverance Rover for our first-year SolidWorks project. 
                I was responsible for the hazard avoidance cameras and the power source. To see all the 
                movable parts and a brief explanation of each part, click <u><a href="https://youtu.be/-NP89RP43i8?si=kg2kdXV_vH5KBM4_">here</a></u>.

                As a part of my setup, I built my own keyboard by purchasing individual parts/components. The keyboard is the main tool of any 
                programmer, so I thought it would be a good idea to build my own so it would have my desired feel, look, and sound.
